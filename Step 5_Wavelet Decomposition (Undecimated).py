Adjusted A-Trous Algorithm

Given a series S(0), S(1), ..., S(99)

1. Carry out discrete wavelet decomposition on S(0), S(1), ..., S(k)
2. Retain the decomposed values for the (k-1)st and kth time points only
3. If k < 100, set k = k + 2 and repeat these steps


retain_dec=[]
k=0
while (k < len(data_ts1)):
    temp_cA, temp_cD = pywt.dwt(data_ts1[:k+2], 'db3')
    retain_dec = retain_dec + [temp_dec[-2:]]
    k = k + 2
    

Getting an error that the decomposition level=3 is too high. for k=0, only get 2 elements
so the max decomposition level would be 1. How did the authors carry this out?
